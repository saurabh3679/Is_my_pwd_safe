This python app will inform you if your password was ever hacked before. Some, Troy Hunt is maintaining the database of the breached data (definitely not all, but all major breaches are documented) and is kind enough to let us use an api to query his database. Using this app is simple. 
From command-line: python passwordHackedOrNot.py <your password>
